# ParallelSparseMatrixFactorization
This project deals with parallel sparse matrix factorization with applications in Intelligent tutoring Systems and Recommendation Systems.
The implementation is done in two ways : 
1. first one is purely cilk and C++ on SLURM 
2. The other method is Using OpenMP, C++ and SLURM. (AlisOpenMP)
